# wordproblems
The ultimate goal of this project is to solve complex mathematical word problems. However, we start with very simple problems, that kids of age 5-8 are likely to encounter. These are problems based on the fundamental of mathematics: addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division.

### Example

'X' has 5 apples. He gives three to 'Y' and donates two more to 'Z'. 'Z' then get two apples from 'Y' and gets one from somewhere else. How many apples does 'Y' have?

__Answer:__ `1`
